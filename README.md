My WebDev course closing project

This is just a closure project ( or rather a exam of sorts) for a web development course i took.
I tried to build my own little framework, based on the structure i picked up in a tutorial. 
It works surprisingly well and the overall structure is not too complicated, i think.

Of course it's not perfect and / or efficient, but like i said: It works! :)
